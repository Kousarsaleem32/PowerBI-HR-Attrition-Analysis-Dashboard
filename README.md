# PowerBI-HR-Attrition-Analysis-Dashboard

This project presents a fully interactive HR Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI. The goal of this project is to help an organization improve employee performance and enhance retention (reduce attrition) by leveraging data insights derived from more than 1,400 employee records.

---

## Objective

To assist HR departments in identifying patterns behind employee attrition and uncover insights about workforce demographics, job roles, and compensation, by:

- Monitoring key HR metrics like attrition rate, average salary, and age distribution.
- Visualizing attrition trends across multiple dimensions such as department, salary, education, and job role.
- Supporting data-driven decisions to reduce turnover and enhance employee engagement.

---

## Tools & Techniques

- Power BI Desktop – for data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard creation.
- Power Query Editor – to clean, transform, and format raw HR data.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – for creating calculated fields and measures.
- CSV Dataset – comprising employee attributes like job role, salary, age, gender, education, and more.

---

## Data Preparation

The raw HR dataset was cleaned and transformed using Power Query, involving:

- Removing null or duplicate entries.
- Converting numerical and categorical data into structured formats.
- Creating derived fields such as "Attrition by Salary Range" and "Years at Company".
- Grouping and aggregating key KPIs for dashboard reporting.
